# Android App Compatibility: the Complete K-to-P Guide [Video]
This is the code repository for [Android App Compatibility: the Complete K-to-P Guide [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/android-app-compatibility-complete-k-p-guide-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788991353), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
This course will help you to make your Android apps backward-compatible and we cover common issues faced by developers in Android. We develop in Java using all its support libraries to show what they are and how they allow us to fight most compatibility issues. You will build a simple application that will allow us to track car fill-ups and review gas stations.

During this course, you will take a closer look at uses for compatibility libraries, walk through its most popular pivots, and skillfully resolve them. Lastly, you will explore a few tools for a more effective market understanding and investigate crashes and A/B testing.

## Instructions and Navigation
### Assumed Knowledge
To fully benefit from the coverage included in this course, you will need:<br/>
The goal of this course is to teach software developers to be successful Android Developers. My intention is to introduce future developers to Android APIs that are actually used by real Android developers to create apps, in addition to supporting Android Lollipop (most Android support libraries actually support all the way back to Android 14 Jelly Bean). This is a Java-based course. I recommend viewers should be comfortable with the Java programming language but any knowledge in an object-oriented language and familiarity with a C-style language are also suitable. In this course we build a gas-tracking app. The app will store locations of gas stations, as well as fill-up dates, gas prices, and track the total amount of gas purchased throughout a given month. By the end of this course, students should have a reasonable understanding of Android's Data Binding, and Room Persistence Libraries will be able to access a device's location in real time.
